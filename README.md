# Frogger arcade-game
Frogger is an arcade game develop by Konami in the early 80s. [wikipidia frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger)

This version is a clone of the original, written with javaScript. The starter code was provided by Udacity as well as the sprites/game assets. Part of the excercise was to implement OOP (object-oriented programming) programming, learned from JS lessons.
